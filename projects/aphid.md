title: "Role of epigenetics in Soybean aphid virulence to aphid-resistant plants"
permalink: /projects/aphid/
---
Growing evidence suggests an important role for DNA methylation in host-pathogen and host-parasite interactions. However the mechanism and the implication of such interactions are poorly characterized. In collaboration with [Andrew Michel's](https://entomology.osu.edu/our-people/andrew-michel) laboratory at the Ohio State University, I am examining how DNA methylation influences soybean aphid (_Aphis glycines_) virulence against host plants.
