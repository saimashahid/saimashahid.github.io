I am a plant biologist interested in mobile elements that regulate gene expression within and across species. Currently, I am a Simons fellow for the Life Sciences Research Foundation, working with [Keith Slotkin](https://www.danforthcenter.org/our-work/principal-investigators/r-keith-slotkin/) on [mobile Transposable Elements](/projects/te/) at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. I received my Ph.D. in plant biology from Penn State University, working with [Mike Axtell](https://sites.psu.edu/axtell/). My dissertation research focused on identifying [trans-species regulatory microRNAs](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature25027) from the parasitic vine _Cuscuta_ (dodder).

Prior to Penn State, I worked as a research associate in [Zeba Seraj's](http://www.du.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_details/BCH/1520/) plant biotechnology lab at the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. I obtained both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the same university.
